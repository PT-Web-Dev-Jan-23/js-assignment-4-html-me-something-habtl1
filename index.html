   <p id="testp">I love nursing.</p>
   
   <p class="funParagraph">I was born in Ethiopia and grew up there until I was 11 years old. I then came to the United States and settled  in Saint Louis, MO with my family in 1999. I already knew english so it was an easy transition for while enrolled in Ladue Middle School. I graduated Ladue high school and went to college to study Nursing.  I finished my Bachelor's degree in Science of Nursing. I have always been fascinated with technology and computers. After working in the nursing field for almost 10 years, I decided to start learning about coding and programming. So I enrolled in LaunchCode to start learning web development.
